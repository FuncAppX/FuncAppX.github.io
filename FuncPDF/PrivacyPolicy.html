<h1>FuncPDF Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 20, 2025</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Your trust is of paramount importance to us, and we are deeply aware of the importance of your personal information. The provider of the FuncPDF service (hereinafter referred to as "we" or "the Service") has formulated this Privacy Policy (the "Policy") to comply with legal requirements and remind you that:</p>
<p>This Policy applies to all products and services provided by <strong>FuncPDF</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Please read this Policy carefully and thoroughly understand it before using any FuncPDF product or service. By using FuncPDF, you confirm that you have fully understood and agreed to this Policy.</strong> If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions regarding this Policy, please contact us using the information provided at the end of this document.</p>

<h2>2. Definitions</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>FuncPDF:</strong> Refers to the FuncPDF mobile application.</li>
    <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Refers to various information recorded electronically or otherwise that can identify a specific natural person, either alone or combined with other information, or reflect the activities of a specific natural person.</li>
    <li><strong>Personal Sensitive Information:</strong> Includes but is not limited to identification numbers, personal biometric information, bank accounts, property information, track records, transaction information, etc. (FuncPDF <strong>does not</strong> actively collect such personal sensitive information).</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Information We Do Not Collect (Key Privacy Feature)</h2>
<p><strong>FuncPDF does not provide user registration or login functionality.</strong> Therefore, we <strong>do not</strong> collect any directly identifying personal account information from you, such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Phone numbers</li>
    <li>Email addresses</li>
    <li>Names</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Information We Collect and How We Use It</h2>
<p>We only collect and use your information for the purposes detailed below:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Data Category Collected</th>
        <th>Purpose and Use</th>
        <th>Data Storage Location</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Purchase History (IAP Transaction Data)</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Purpose:</strong> To verify and manage the user's subscription/purchase rights, confirm the validity period of the service, and deliver the purchased features.</td>
        <td><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Stored only locally on the device (App Sandbox).</strong> This data is <strong>not</strong> uploaded to our servers.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>File Data (User Generated Content)</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Purpose:</strong> To enable the core features of FuncPDF, allowing users to select files from the device's file manager and photo library. All file access, editing, conversion, and storage are performed <strong>locally</strong> on your device and are solely for the App's core functionality.</td>
        <td><strong style="font-weight: bold;">Stored only locally on the device (App Sandbox or your personal iCloud). We do not access, view, or upload your files to our servers.</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Device and Usage Information</td>
        <td><strong>Purpose:</strong> Internal data analysis to optimize product performance and diagnose faults. <strong>Information includes:</strong> Device model, operating system version, application version, and session start/stop times.</td>
        <td>Stored locally on the device. We currently <strong>do not</strong> integrate third-party analytics SDKs.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Regarding Cookies and Similar Technologies:</strong></p>
<p>The FuncPDF App itself <strong>does not</strong> use cookies or similar tracking technologies. Any mention of cookies in associated materials only applies to any related websites we may operate, not the App itself.</p>

<h2>5. Data Sharing, Transfer, and Disclosure</h2>
<p>We are committed to <strong>not</strong> sharing, transferring, or publicly disclosing your Personal Information to any other company, organization, or individual, except in the following circumstances:</p>
<ol>
    <li>With explicit consent: Sharing, transferring, or disclosing with your clear authorization.</li>
    <li>Legal Requirements: As required by applicable laws, legal procedures, litigation, or mandatory requirements from governmental authorities.</li>
    <li>Sharing with Authorized Partners (Currently None): Our service currently does not integrate any third-party SDKs that collect your Personal Information. Should we integrate future partners, we will update this Policy promptly and seek your renewed authorization and consent.</li>
</ol>

<h2>6. Data Retention and Storage</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Storage Location: Personal Information collected and generated during our operation within the People's Republic of China is stored within China.</li>
    <li>Retention Period: We will retain your Personal Information (such as purchase status) only for the period necessary to achieve the purposes described in this Policy, unless mandatory legal retention requirements apply.</li>
    <li>Data Deletion: Since FuncPDF does not store account information, uninstalling the App effectively deletes all stored local purchase status and usage data within the App's sandbox on your device. Upon exceeding the retention period, we will delete your Personal Information as required by applicable law.</li>
</ol>

<h2>7. Security Measures</h2>
<p>We have implemented security protection measures that meet industry standards to protect the Personal Information you provide, preventing unauthorized access, public disclosure, use, modification, damage, or loss of data. For example, we use SSL encryption to ensure the confidentiality of data during transmission.</p>
<p>We will take all reasonable and practical measures to ensure that no irrelevant Personal Information is collected. While the internet is not 100% secure, we will strive to ensure the security of any information you transmit to us. In the event of a Personal Information security incident, we will promptly inform you of the basic situation and potential impact as required by laws and regulations.</p>

<h2>8. Your Rights and Subscription Management</h2>
<p>Due to the non-collection of directly identifying personal account information, your control over your information is primarily managed through the following methods:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Data Deletion: You can clear all purchase status and usage data stored locally on your device by uninstalling the App or clearing the App cache.</li>
    <li>File Access and Deletion: You can access, edit, and delete the files you store <strong>at any time within the App.</strong></li>
    <li>Subscription Management: For IAP subscription services purchased through the Apple App Store, you can manage your subscription at any time using the official Apple link:
        <p><strong>App Store Subscription Management Link:</strong> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/account/subscriptions">https://apps.apple.com/account/subscriptions</a></p>
    </li>
    <li>Making Requests: If you need to exercise other rights or make requests regarding this Policy, please contact us via the email address provided below.</li>
</ol>

<h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>FuncPDF is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 18, you should review this Policy and use the FuncPDF software and related services under the supervision and guidance of your legal guardian and with their consent. We take the protection of minors' Personal Information seriously.</p>

<h2>10. Updates to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may adjust or change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will announce any updates on our official website or within the App, indicating the updated date. The adjusted or changed content will take effect <strong>7 days</strong> after being announced or published. Your continued use of any of our services after the Policy has been adjusted or changed indicates that you have fully read, understood, and accepted the modified Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>11. Dispute Resolution and Governing Law</h2>
<p>The place of execution of this agreement is the People's Republic of China. If a dispute arises between you and the Service, both parties should try to resolve it through friendly negotiation. Should negotiation fail, you agree to submit the dispute to the People's Court with jurisdiction in the location of the Service provider for litigation.</p>
